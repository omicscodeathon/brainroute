Predicting Blood-Brain Barrier-Permeable mTOR Inhibitors for Alzheimer’s Disease Using Machine Learning

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective physiological interface that regulates the transport of molecules between the bloodstream and the central nervous system (CNS). BBB permeability 
is a decisive factor in determining whether a therapeutic compound can reach its CNS target. Many potential drug candidates fail late in development due to inadequate BBB penetration, causing 
substantial financial and time losses.

Predicting BBB permeability early in the drug discovery process can streamline candidate selection, reduce attrition rates, and focus experimental resources on the most promising molecules. While 
existing computational tools exist, many lack transparency, reproducibility, or the ability to handle domain-specific datasets.

This project proposes NeuroGate, an open-source, reproducible computational platform for predicting BBB permeability. The platform is designed to be general-purpose—capable of evaluating molecules 
across a variety of therapeutic areas—but will demonstrate its capabilities through case studies in neurodegenerative disease drug discovery, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where BBB penetration 
is crucial for targeting the mTOR pathway and other CNS-relevant mechanisms.
